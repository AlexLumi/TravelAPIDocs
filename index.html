        <p>This project was maintained using GitHub, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Desktop. GitHub is a website and cloud service that helps developers store and manage their code. The developer can track and control any changes to their code in what is called version control.

GitHub Pages is another feature of GitHub which is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Through GitHub Pages, you will host your site with the domain name github.io. It is possible to use a custom domain, but for the purpose of the capstone, this TravelAPI uses the provided domain.
Using GitHub Desktop, the code was able to be pushed to the repository easy and was able to add update comments.
<br><br>
The programming language of this API is with the use of Python 3 and the complier that was used was PyCharm. Within the code, it uses imports like BeautifulSoup4, Pandas, Requests, etc. These must be downloaded in order to properly utilize the TravelAPI.
The API searches through an excel database from this site for some of the functions related to airport information. The Global Airport Database is comprised from a series of tuples. Each tuple contains exactly 16 fields of varying pieces of information. The fields depending on what they represent are either a text string, integer, floating point or character. The image below is for the paper or offline documentation of using TravelAPI.
